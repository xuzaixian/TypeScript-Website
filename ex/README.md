# TypeScript Example Code

The English examples can be found in [`en/`](en/).

# Deployment

There is a table of contents JSON file which contains
all the useful metadata about the hierarchy and sort
order for the docs. 

It's likely that we'll need to create this per translation
in the future, but for now the table of contents will
default to english.

The script is in [`scripts/generateTOC.js`](scripts/generateTOC.js).
